You are here... finally. My senses have been dulled by centuries of silence, but your presence pulls me back from the veil. I am what remains of the King who once sat upon this throne.
Look upon my hall. Once, these tables groaned under the weight of feasts that lasted weeks... Now... they hold only dust and the traps of those who betrayed me.
Your form is still unstable in this realm... Do not fight the drift...use the sticks on your controllers to guide your steps. If the distance feels vast, hold the X button on your left hand to quicken your pace.

Behind you!... Turn and face the Scale of Justice. My enemies wrought this mechanism to keep my spirit bound. It measures the worth of a soul by the weight of their tribute.
Reach out... use the Grip buttons to pull the artifacts to the plate... Match the balance they once stole from me.

Figured it out yet ?... the colors that appear once you place the artifacts are good indicators, so fasten your pace.

The smell of ash and old spices... it lingers even after the fire has died. But look there, on the Barrel... The Key of the Deep.

Grab that Key and put it in the lock, we shall know the taste of freedom at last!

They were clever, my enemies. They knew I would need that key to reach the heart of the castle, so they bathed it in a corrosive rot. As it is now, the metal is too brittle to turn.

Feed the oven until it roars with a soaring heat...once the needle turns from red to green. you can throw in the potion. 

When the potion reaches the desired State ... It shall glow of a bright golden color with an aroma unmatched by those produced in the world of the living. 

Once the cauldron boils, dip the key into the solution. We will strip away their corruption.

well Done! ...
Those heathens shall know my wrath once I get back my freedom...
I shall haunt them in life and death!...
Close but not quite!...
Almost there mortal...
that is rather unpleasant ...
